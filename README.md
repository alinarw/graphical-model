# Exacting Inference with Probabilistic Graphical Models
Making exact inferences about probabilistic graphical models using the graphical model packages in Python.
1. Draw the moral graph, triangulated graph and the junction tree. Explain why the ”running intersection property” is satisﬁed in your junction tree.
2. Describe how the diﬀerent terms are distributed among the diﬀerent junction tree clusters. Write out the messages using these terms and verify that the message passing algorithm gives the cluster marginals.
#### Tools & Liblaries: Python 2, Bayesian Belief Networks
